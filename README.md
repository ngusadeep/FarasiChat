python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure environment variables:

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

5. (Optional) Initialize DB tables if persistent memory is used:

```bash
python init_db.py
```

This README positions **Winnie** as a **full, production-ready AI assistant**, not just a starter. It explains setup, usage, structure, and extensibility clearly for developers.  

If you want, I can also **add a visual diagram of the MVC architecture** and AI flow to include in this README, which makes it even more professional.  

Do you want me to do that next?
